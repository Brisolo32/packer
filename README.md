<h3 align="center">A tool to pack multiple lua files into one</h3>

## What is Packer?

Packer is a tool to compress multiple lua files into one single file, it was designed to make it easier to make plugins for Black Pearl Origin, as BPO can only read one single lua file

## What is the stage?

Packer is mostly done (this means you can use it fine), it will only recieve feature updates and bugfixes, but they won't be as common since it's basically done :kek:

## How can I contribute?

We welcome any contributions to this project, be it code, or just general feedback. You can check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file on the BPO repo for more information on how to contribute via code.
